# My Portfolio

This portfolio was created following a [video]("https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESHaail1eGc&t=3931s") guide by [Slobodan]("youtube.com/c/CodewithSloba").

This guide was used for educational purposes with the intention of improving my React skills, implement an email API, work with animations, and work with react-router for the first time.

You can check out the portfolio at: [https://mckinnondave.github.io/]("https://mckinnondave.github.io/")
